# VirtualBrowser

VirtualBrowser is a fingerprint browser built on [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/). It lets you create and manage multiple isolated browser profiles on a single Windows 7+ machine. Support for Mac, Android, Linux, and other platforms is planned.

**Browser fingerprinting** collects signals from the browser, OS, and hardware (User-Agent, language, resolution, fonts, Canvas/WebGL noise, and more) to build a digital signature that can identify or link users. VirtualBrowser helps you isolate fingerprints per profile and reduce cross-account correlation and tracking—when used lawfully and responsibly.

## Features

- **Multi-profile isolation**: Run many independent fingerprint environments on one machine
- **Centralized management**: Create, launch, edit, and remove environments from one place
- **Broad fingerprint coverage**: UA, proxy, language/timezone, WebRTC, geolocation, Canvas/WebGL, AudioContext, and more (see table below)
- **Automation-ready**: Works with Playwright and other Chromium automation tools; see [automation](automation/)

## Quick Start

### Install

Download the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/Virtual-Browser/VirtualBrowser/releases) or the official site: [virtualbrowser.cc](https://virtualbrowser.cc) · [vbbrowser.com](https://www.vbbrowser.com/)

### Create a profile

1. Open VirtualBrowser and click **Create Browser**

2. Adjust settings in the dialog or keep the defaults
   ![Create profile](assets/create.png)
   ![Profile created](assets/createsuccess.png)

### Launch a profile

1. Click **Start** on the profile you created
2. The new window runs with that profile’s isolated fingerprint
